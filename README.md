## Dallas Building Permits
Processing [Dallas Bulding Permits](https://developdallas.dallascityhall.com/) has a been an issue for the city Dallas. A massive [backlog](https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/dallas-permit-process-delays-11968181) of pending buidling permits has slowed down the city's ability to add desparately needed housing. The focus of this project is to harvest city permits data and create a Flask-RestFul API with city building data. Only "New Construction" permit data will be captured.

### Updates:
10-23-21: Flaks API completed. See Git repo for latest updates. Deployment/API instructions coming soon..
